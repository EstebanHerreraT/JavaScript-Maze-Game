# JavaScript-Maze-Game

This program is a simple Maze Game where the player starts at the top-left corner of a grid and navigates to the bottom right corner, avoiding walls while using keyboard controls. The maze layout changes dynamically based on the selected difficulty, and it always ensures that there is a solvable path between the starting and ending points.
